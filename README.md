A plugin-like image gallery package for Laravel applications. Drop it into any Laravel project to get galleries and image uploads via a clean, modern API.

## Features

- Gallery CRUD API endpoints
- Multiple image uploads per gallery
- Configurable storage disk and path
- Automatic file cleanup on deletion
- Database migrations and model factories
- Full Pest test suite targeting 100% coverage
- PHPStan level 7 and Laravel Pint enforcement

## Requirements

- PHP ^8.3
- Laravel ^13.0

## Installation

Install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require caasidev/laravel-gallery
```

The service provider will be auto-discovered by Laravel.

## Configuration

Publish the config file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=gallery-config
```

The default config is:

```php
return [
    'disk' => env('GALLERY_DISK', 'public'),
    'path' => env('GALLERY_PATH', 'galleries'),
    'middleware' => ['api', 'auth'],
];
```

The default disk is `public`, so make sure the storage link exists:

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

The `middleware` value controls route-level protection. If your app is API-only (e.g. Sanctum), change it to `['api', 'auth:sanctum']` or any middleware your project uses:

```php
'middleware' => ['api', 'auth:sanctum'],
```

Run the migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## Usage

### API Endpoints

All gallery routes are authenticated and scoped to the current user. Galleries and images created through the API are owned by the authenticated user and hidden from other users.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/galleries` | List all galleries |
| POST | `/api/v1/galleries` | Create a gallery |
| GET | `/api/v1/galleries/{gallery}` | Show a gallery |
| PUT/PATCH | `/api/v1/galleries/{gallery}` | Update a gallery |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/galleries/{gallery}` | Delete a gallery |
| POST | `/api/v1/galleries/{gallery}/images` | Upload images to a gallery |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/galleries/{gallery}/images/{image}` | Delete a gallery image |

### Creating a Gallery

```bash
curl -X POST http://your-app.test/api/v1/galleries \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -F "name=Summer Photos" \
  -F "description=A simple gallery" \
  -F "image=@cover.jpg"
```

### Uploading Images

```bash
curl -X POST http://your-app.test/api/v1/galleries/1/images \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -F "images[]=@photo1.jpg" \
  -F "images[]=@photo2.jpg"
```

## Testing

composer test
```

```
